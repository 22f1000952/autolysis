# Happiness Dataset Analysis Report

## 1. Dataset Overview
The happiness dataset consists of **2,363 records** and **11 columns** that capture various metrics related to happiness across different countries and years. The key columns include:

- **Country name**: Name of the country
- **year**: Year of the data
- **Life Ladder**: A measure of subjective well-being
- **Log GDP per capita**: A logarithmic transformation of GDP per capita
- **Social support**: Perceived social support
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: Average expected lifespan at birth
- **Freedom to make life choices**: Degree of freedom in decision-making
- **Generosity**: Measure of charitable behavior
- **Perceptions of corruption**: Beliefs about corruption in government and business
- **Positive affect**: Frequency of positive emotions
- **Negative affect**: Frequency of negative emotions

### Missing Values
The dataset has several missing values in key columns, such as:
- Log GDP per capita: 28 missing
- Social support: 13 missing
- Healthy life expectancy at birth: 63 missing
- Freedom to make life choices: 36 missing
- Generosity: 81 missing
- Perceptions of corruption: 125 missing
- Positive affect: 24 missing
- Negative affect: 16 missing

## 2. Analyses Performed
### 2.1 Correlation Analysis
A correlation analysis was conducted to understand the relationships between the numeric variables in the dataset. This analysis is relevant as it helps identify how different factors contribute to overall happiness levels and can inform targeted interventions.

### 2.2 Distribution Analysis
The distribution of the **year** variable was analyzed to see trends over time. Understanding the temporal distribution of data helps in assessing any changes in happiness metrics over the years.

### 2.3 Top Categories Analysis
An analysis was performed to identify the top countries in terms of the number of records. This provides insights into which countries are most frequently represented in the dataset, potentially indicating areas of interest for further investigation.

## 3. Key Insights Derived from the Analyses
### 3.1 Correlation Analysis Insights
- **Life Ladder**: Strong positive correlations were observed with **Log GDP per capita** (0.78) and **Social support** (0.72), indicating that economic prosperity and social networks significantly contribute to perceived happiness.
- **Negative Affect**: It was negatively correlated with **Positive Affect** (-0.33), suggesting that as positive emotions increase, negative emotions tend to decrease.

### 3.2 Year Distribution Insights
The distribution of the **year** variable indicates an increasing trend in the number of records over time, with peaks observed around certain years. This could reflect increased interest in happiness studies or improved data collection efforts.

### 3.3 Top Categories Insights
The top five countries with the most records are **Argentina, Costa Rica, Brazil, Bolivia,** and **Bangladesh**, each with approximately 18 records. This indicates a diverse representation of countries, particularly from Latin America and South Asia.

## 4. Implications or Recommendations
Based on the findings, several implications and recommendations can be made:

- **Policy Focus**: Countries with lower **Life Ladder** scores should consider implementing policies that enhance social support systems and improve economic conditions, as these factors are strongly correlated with happiness levels.
- **Further Research**: Additional research should be conducted to investigate the missing values in key variables, particularly in countries with significant gaps. This could enhance the dataset's robustness.
- **Targeted Interventions**: Programs aimed at increasing **Generosity** and reducing perceived **corruption** may positively impact overall happiness, as these variables also show significant correlations.
